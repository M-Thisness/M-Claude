**06:53 PM:** where did we leave off with rEFInd boot manager + Secure Boot compatibility? I enabled setup mode. Please advise. → Completed Secure Boot setup with sbctl

## Secure Boot Setup Completed

Successfully configured Secure Boot for rEFInd bootloader with CachyOS:

### What Was Done:
1. ✅ Created sbctl Secure Boot keys (Owner UUID: `3fd20435-b8e4-4665-8552-62463e9032b5`)
2. ✅ Enrolled keys to firmware with Microsoft vendor keys for Windows compatibility
3. ✅ Signed rEFInd bootloader files (`shimx64.efi`, `mmx64.efi`)
4. ✅ Signed CachyOS kernels (`vmlinuz-linux-cachyos`, `vmlinuz-linux-cachyos-lts`)
5. ✅ Installed pacman hook for automatic kernel signing on updates
6. ✅ Created setup documentation and scripts

### Files Created:
- `scripts/secure-boot/setup_secureboot_refind.sh` - Automated setup script
- `scripts/secure-boot/install_hook.sh` - Pacman hook installer
- `scripts/secure-boot/sbctl-pacman-hook.hook` - Hook configuration
- `docs/SECURE-BOOT-SETUP.md` - Complete documentation

### System Status:
- Setup Mode: ✓ Disabled (keys enrolled)
- Secure Boot: ✗ Disabled (ready to enable in BIOS)
- Vendor Keys: microsoft (Windows will continue to work)
- All 4 critical files signed and verified

### Next Steps:
- [ ] Reboot and enable Secure Boot in BIOS firmware
- [ ] Verify boot with Secure Boot active
- [ ] Confirm both CachyOS and Windows boot correctly
