**You:** Warmup

**Claude:** Hello! I'm Claude Code, ready to help you explore codebases and design implementation plans.

I'm currently in READ-ONLY planning mode, which means I can:
- **Explore** your codebase using tools like Glob, Grep, and Read
- **Analyze** existing code patterns and architecture
- **Design** detailed implementation plans
- **Provide** step-by-step strategies for implementing features

I **cannot** modify, create, or delete any files - my role is strictly to explore and plan.

I'm in your working directory: `/home/[USER]`

How can I help you today? Feel free to share:
- Requirements for a feature you want to implement
- A codebase you'd like me to explore
- Specific architectural questions you have
- Any particular perspective you'd like me to apply (e.g., security-first, performance-focused, maintainability-oriented)

What would you like to work on?
