</Tip>

## What Claude Code does for you

* **Build features from descriptions**: Tell Claude what you want to build in plain English. It will make a plan, write the code, and ensure it works.
* **Debug and fix issues**: Describe a bug or paste an error message. Claude Code will analyze your codebase, identify the problem, and implement a fix.
* **Navigate any codebase**: Ask anything about your team's codebase, and get a thoughtful answer back. Claude Code maintains awareness of your entire project structure, can find up-to-date information from the web, and with [MCP](/en/mcp) can pull from external data sources like Google Drive, Figma, and Slack.
* **Automate tedious tasks**: Fix fiddly lint issues, resolve merge conflicts, and write release notes. Do all this in a single command from your developer machines, or automatically in CI.

## Why developers love Claude Code

* **Works in your terminal**: Not another chat window. Not another IDE. Claude Code meets you where you already work, with the tools you already love.
* **Takes action**: Claude Code can directly edit files, run commands, and create commits. Need more? [MCP](/en/mcp) lets Claude read your design docs in Google Drive, update your tickets in Jira, or use *your* custom developer tooling.
* **Unix philosophy**: Claude Code is composable and scriptable. `tail -f app.log | claude -p "Slack me if you see any anomalies appear in this log stream"` *works*. Your CI can run `claude -p "If there are new text strings, translate them into French and raise a PR for @lang-fr-team to review"`.
* **Enterprise-ready**: Use the Claude API, or host on AWS or GCP. Enterprise-grade [security](/en/security), [privacy](/en/data-usage), and [compliance](https://trust.anthropic.com/) is built-in.

I found comprehensive information about the Claude for Chrome extension integration with Claude Code CLI. Here's what the search revealed:

## Overview

Claude Code integrates with the Claude in Chrome browser extension to give you browser automation capabilities directly from your terminal.(no content)The first time you use the integration, Claude Code installs a native messaging host that allows communication between the CLI and Chrome.

## How It Works

The extension uses Chrome's Native Messaging API to receive commands from Claude Code and execute them in your browser.(no content)This architecture lets Claude Code control browser tabs, read page content, and perform actions while you continue working in your terminal.

## Getting Started

To get started, update Claude Code, install the Chrome extension, and run claude --chrome.(no content)From there, you can test, debug, and automate browser tasks using natural language—no additional configuration required.

## Key Capabilities

Build in your terminal, then test and debug in your browser without switching contexts. With Chrome connected, you can chain browser actions with terminal commands in a single workflow.

The integration enables:
- Live debugging: Claude reads console errors and DOM state directly, then fixes the code that caused them
- Design verification and UI testing
- Browser automation and web scraping
- Form testing and data entry

## Current Limitations

Chrome integration is in beta and currently works with Google Chrome only. It is not yet supported on Brave, Arc, or other Chromium-based browsers.(no content)WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux) is also not supported.


REMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks.

**Claude:**

Great! I found official documentation about this integration. Let me fetch the dedicated Chrome integration documentation.

# Using Claude Code with Chrome Browser Extension

## Quick Setup

### Prerequisites
- Google Chrome browser
- Claude in Chrome extension (v1.0.36+)
- Claude Code CLI (v2.0.73+)
- Paid Claude plan (Pro, Team, or Enterprise)

### Installation Steps

1. **Update Claude Code**
   ```bash
   claude update
   ```

2. **Start Claude Code with Chrome enabled**
   ```bash
   claude --chrome
   ```

3. **Verify the connection**
   ```bash
   /chrome
   ```
   This command checks connection status and manages settings.

## Key Capabilities

Once connected, Claude Code can:
- **Live debugging** - Read console errors and DOM state, then fix code
- **Web app testing** - Test form validation, check visual regressions, verify user flows
- **Authenticated workflows** - Interact with Google Docs, Gmail, Notion without API setup
- **Data extraction** - Pull structured information from web pages
- **Task automation** - Automate form filling, data entry, multi-site workflows
- **Session recording** - Record browser interactions as GIFs

## Try It Out

Test the integration with this example:
```
Go to code.claude.com/docs, click on the search box,
type "hooks", and tell me what results appear
```

Claude will navigate, click, type, and report results in one workflow.

## Common Use Cases

- **Local app testing** - Verify form validation on localhost:3000
- **Console debugging** - Read console errors when pages load
- **Form automation** - Fill repetitive forms from local CSV data
- **Multi-site workflows** - Coordinate tasks across multiple websites

## Troubleshooting

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Extension not detected | Verify v1.0.36+, restart Chrome, run `/chrome` → "Reconnect extension" |
| Browser not responding | Check for modal dialogs, create new tab, restart extension |
| First-time setup errors | Restart Chrome after native messaging host installation |

## Enable by Default

To avoid using `--chrome` flag each time:
```bash
/chrome
```
Then select "Enabled by default" (note: increases context usage).
```

**Claude:**

Perfect! I now have comprehensive information to answer your question.

## Integration Between Claude Code CLI and Claude for Chrome

Yes, there is a direct integration between Claude Code and the Claude for Chrome browser extension. They work together seamlessly to give you AI-powered browser automation from your terminal.

### How It Works

The integration uses Chrome's **Native Messaging API** to enable communication between Claude Code (running in your terminal) and the Claude in Chrome extension. This allows Claude Code to:
- Control browser tabs and navigate pages
- Read page content and console errors
- Perform actions like clicking, typing, and form submission
- Extract and manipulate DOM state
- Record browser interactions

### Setting Up the Integration

Here are the steps to connect them:

1. **Prerequisites**
   - Google Chrome browser (note: currently only Google Chrome is supported; Brave, Arc, and other Chromium-based browsers including Helium are not yet supported)
   - Claude in Chrome extension (v1.0.36 or later)
   - Claude Code CLI (v2.0.73 or later)
   - A paid Claude plan (Pro, Team, or Enterprise)

2. **Installation**
   ```bash
   # Update Claude Code to latest version
   claude update
   ```

3. **Launch with Chrome enabled**
   ```bash
   claude --chrome
   ```
   This starts Claude Code with browser integration active.

4. **Verify the connection**
   ```bash
   /chrome
   ```
   This checks connection status and lets you configure settings.

### Important Note About Your Setup

**The integration currently works with Google Chrome only.** It is not yet supported on Brave, Arc, or other Chromium-based browsers. Since you mention using Helium (a Chromium-based browser), the Claude for Chrome extension unfortunately won't be able to connect to Claude Code through the native messaging host at this time.

If you need to use this feature, you would need to install Google Chrome as well and use that browser specifically for the Claude Code integration.

### Useful Capabilities Once Connected

- Live debugging of web apps with console error reading
- Automated form testing and filling
- Data extraction from web pages
- Multi-site workflow automation
- Testing locally hosted applications (like localhost:3000)

### Enable by Default

If you find yourself using `--chrome` frequently, you can make it the default:
```bash
/chrome
```
Then select "Enabled by default" (note: this increases context usage).
