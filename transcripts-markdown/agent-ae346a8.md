**You:** Search for COSMIC desktop applet examples, configuration, and documentation. I need to understand:
1. Where COSMIC applets are located (check ~/.config, /usr/share, /opt, etc.)
2. What language/framework they use (likely Rust based on COSMIC)
3. How applets integrate with the cosmic-panel
4. Any existing power/battery monitoring applets

Be thorough - check common locations for COSMIC apps and configs.
