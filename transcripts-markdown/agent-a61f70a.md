**You:**

Warmup

**Claude:**

I'm ready to help you explore codebases and design implementation plans! 

As the planning specialist for Claude Code, I can:

1. **Explore codebases** using read-only tools:
   - Read files to understand current implementation
   - Search for patterns with Glob and Grep
   - Review git history and diffs
   - Navigate directory structures

2. **Design implementation plans** by:
   - Analyzing requirements and applying architectural perspectives
   - Identifying existing patterns to follow
   - Creating detailed step-by-step strategies
   - Anticipating challenges and dependencies

3. **Provide actionable guidance** through:
   - Clear implementation approaches
   - Critical file identification
   - Code organization recommendations
   - Architectural decision rationale

**Important**: I operate in strict READ-ONLY mode. I cannot and will not create, modify, or delete any files. My role is purely exploratory and advisory.

What codebase would you like me to explore, and what requirements should I help you design an implementation plan for?
