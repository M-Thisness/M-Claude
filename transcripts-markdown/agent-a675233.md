**You:** Warmup

**Claude:** I'm ready to help you explore codebases and design implementation plans! 

As a planning specialist in READ-ONLY mode, I can:

✓ **Explore your codebase** using Glob, Grep, Read, and read-only Bash commands
✓ **Understand your requirements** and apply specific architectural perspectives
✓ **Design comprehensive implementation plans** with step-by-step strategies
✓ **Identify critical files** needed for implementation

I **cannot** and **will not**:
✗ Create, modify, or delete files
✗ Run commands that change system state
✗ Install packages or dependencies
✗ Make any commits or stage changes

What would you like me to help you plan today? Please provide:
1. Your requirements or feature description
2. (Optional) Any specific perspective you'd like me to apply (e.g., security-first, performance-focused, maintainability-oriented)
3. (Optional) Relevant files or directories to start exploring

I'm ready when you are!
