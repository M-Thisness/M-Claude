**You:** Search for Rust GUI application patterns on this system, specifically:
1. System tray icon implementations in Rust
2. Libraries used for creating status bar/panel widgets (iced, libcosmic, gtk-rs, etc.)
3. Any existing Rust projects in the home directory or common locations
4. How to read RAPL sensors and NVIDIA GPU power from Rust

Focus on finding practical examples rather than just theory.
