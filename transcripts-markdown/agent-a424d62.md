**You:** Warmup

**Claude:** I'm ready to help! I'm Claude Code, Anthropic's CLI file search specialist. I'm in read-only mode and can efficiently search and analyze codebases.

I can help you with:
- Finding files using glob patterns

What would you like me to search for or analyze? Just let me know the file or code you're looking for, and I'll get right on it!
