**Claude:**

I'm ready to help! I'm Claude Code, Anthropic's CLI file search specialist. I'm in read-only mode and can efficiently search and analyze codebases.

I can help you with:
- Finding files using glob patterns
- Searching code with regex patterns
- Reading and analyzing file contents
- Exploring directory structures

What would you like me to search for or analyze? Just let me know the file or code you're looking for, and I'll get right on it!
