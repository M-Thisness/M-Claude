**You:** how to configure alacritty

<details><summary>💭 thinking</summary>
The user is asking how to configure Alacritty, which is a terminal emulator. This is a straightforward informational question about software configuration. I should provide clear, concise information about how to configure Alacritty.

I don't need to use the TodoWrite tool for this since it's just providing information, not performing a task.

Let me provide information about:
1. Where the config file is located
2. The format of the config file
3. Common configuration options
4. How to reload the config

I should keep this concise and practical since I'm in a CLI environment.
</details>

**Claude:** Alacritty is configured via a TOML configuration file located at:

**Linux/BSD**: `~/.config/alacritty/alacritty.toml`
**macOS**: `~/.config/alacritty/alacritty.toml`
**Windows**: `%APPDATA%\alacritty\alacritty.toml`

## Basic Configuration

Here's a simple example configuration:

```toml
[window]
opacity = 0.9
padding.x = 10
padding.y = 10

[font]
size = 12.0

[font.normal]
family = "JetBrains Mono"
style = "Regular"

[colors.primary]
background = "#1e1e2e"
foreground = "#cdd6f4"

[cursor]
style = "Block"
```

## Common Configuration Options

- **Font**: family, size, style
- **Window**: opacity, padding, decorations
- **Colors**: themes/color schemes
- **Cursor**: style, blinking
- **Scrolling**: history size
- **Key bindings**: custom keyboard shortcuts

## Getting Started

1. Create the config directory if it doesn't exist:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p ~/.config/alacritty
   ```

2. Create or edit the config file:
   ```bash
   nvim ~/.config/alacritty/alacritty.toml
   ```

3. Changes take effect automatically (Alacritty watches the file)

You can find the full default configuration and all available options in the official documentation: https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty/blob/master/extra/man/alacritty.5.scd

**You:** open my current alacritty config file

<details><summary>💭 thinking</summary>
The user wants me to open their current Alacritty config file. I should read the file at the expected location for Linux, which is `~/.config/alacritty/alacritty.toml`. Let me read that file.
</details>

*Read: `/home/mischa/.config/alacritty/alacritty.toml`*

<details><summary>💭 thinking</summary>
Great, I've successfully read the user's Alacritty config file. It's a well-structured configuration using the Nord color scheme, with some customizations like:
- 80% opacity
- Underline cursor
- 12pt font size
- Monospace font family
- Various keyboard bindings
- 10000 lines of scrolling history
- Dynamic padding enabled

The file looks normal and is not malware. I should present this to the user and see if they need help with anything specific.
</details>

**Claude:** Here's your current Alacritty configuration at `/home/mischa/.config/alacritty/alacritty.toml`:

**Key Settings:**
- **Theme**: Nord color scheme (lines 27-49)
- **Opacity**: 0.8 (80% opacity) at line 9
- **Font**: monospace, size 12 (lines 51-68)
- **Cursor**: Underline style (line 75)
- **Window**: 100 columns × 30 lines, dynamic padding (lines 6, 12-14)
- **Scrolling**: 10000 lines of history (line 21)
- **Features**: Auto-save to clipboard, hide mouse when typing

The config includes standard keyboard bindings for copy/paste (Ctrl+Shift+C/V), font size control (Ctrl+0 to reset), and search functionality (Ctrl+Shift+F/B).

Would you like to modify any of these settings?

**You:** make the theme match the default vscode dark theme

<details><summary>💭 thinking</summary>
The user wants me to change the Alacritty color scheme to match the default VS Code dark theme. I need to update the colors section to use VS Code's default dark theme colors.

VS Code's default dark theme (Dark+) uses these colors:
- Background: #1e1e1e
- Foreground: #d4d4d4
- Black: #000000
- Red: #cd3131
- Green: #0dbc79 or #4ec9b0 (there are variations)
- Yellow: #e5e510 or #dcdcaa
- Blue: #2472c8 or #569cd6
- Magenta: #bc3fbc or #c586c0
- Cyan: #11a8cd or #4ec9b0
- White: #e5e5e5

Let me use the common VS Code Dark+ theme colors. I'll need to edit the [colors.primary], [colors.normal], and [colors.bright] sections.
</details>

*Edit: `/home/mischa/.config/alacritty/alacritty.toml`*

Good! I've updated the color scheme to match VS Code's default dark theme. The changes include:
- Background changed from Nord's #2E3440 to VS Code's #1e1e1e
- Foreground changed from #D8DEE9 to #d4d4d4
- All the normal and bright colors updated to match VS Code Dark+ theme

Since Alacritty has live config reload enabled (line 163), the changes should take effect immediately.
</details>

**Claude:** Done! I've updated your Alacritty theme to match VS Code's default dark theme (Dark+). The changes include:

- **Background**: Changed from Nord's blue-gray (#2E3440) to VS Code's dark gray (#1e1e1e)
- **Foreground**: Changed to VS Code's light gray (#d4d4d4)
- **All terminal colors**: Updated to match VS Code's color palette

Since you have `live_config_reload = true` enabled, the changes should take effect immediately in any open Alacritty windows. If not, you may need to open a new terminal window to see the updated theme.
