**You:** I need detailed information about enabling Secure Boot with this specific setup:

- Bootloader: rEFInd
- OS: CachyOS (Arch-based)
- Dual boot: Windows (Boot[REDACTED_PHONE]) + CachyOS via rEFInd (Boot[REDACTED_PHONE])
- System: Lenovo Legion Pro 7

Questions:
1. Is Secure Boot compatible with rEFInd?
2. Will Secure Boot work with CachyOS/Arch Linux?
3. Can I install a second Linux distribution with Secure Boot enabled?
4. What's the signing process for rEFInd + unsigned Arch kernels?
5. Should I use shim, PreLoader, or sbctl for this setup?
6. Will dual boot with Windows still work?

Please search for official rEFInd documentation, Arch wiki, and CachyOS-specific information about Secure Boot.
