# Human-Readable Conversation Transcripts

This directory contains beautiful, markdown-formatted versions of all Claude Code conversations.

## What's Here

**52 conversations** automatically converted from JSONL to clean, readable Markdown format.

## Features

✨ **Collapsible Thinking Blocks** - Claude's reasoning process in expandable sections
💬 **Clear Message Attribution** - Easy to distinguish between you and Claude
🔧 **Formatted Tool Usage** - Commands, file operations, and web searches beautifully displayed
📊 **Organized Index** - Sorted by date with message counts

## How It Works

This directory is **automatically generated** by GitHub Actions whenever new JSONL transcripts are added.

The conversion script (`scripts/convert_to_markdown.py`):
1. Parses JSONL conversation files
2. Formats user messages, Claude's thinking, responses, and tool usage
3. Creates beautiful, navigable Markdown documents
4. Generates this index for easy browsing
