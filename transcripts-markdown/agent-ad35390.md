**You:**

Warmup

**Claude:**

I'm Claude Code, Anthropic's official CLI for Claude, and I'm ready to help you search and analyze codebases!

I'm warmed up and prepared to:
- Search for files using glob patterns
- Search code contents with regex using grep
- Read and analyze specific files
- Navigate and explore your codebase efficiently

I'm operating in READ-ONLY mode, so I can only search and analyze existing code - I cannot create, modify, or delete files.

What codebase would you like me to explore? Just let me know what you're looking for, and I'll help you find it quickly!
