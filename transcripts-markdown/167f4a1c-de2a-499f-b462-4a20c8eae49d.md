<summary>💭 Claude's Thinking</summary>

The user just sent "resume". This is a bit unclear - they might want me to:
1. Resume a previous task or conversation
2. Help them with their resume/CV
3. Continue something we were working on

Since I don't have any context about what was happening before, I should ask for clarification about what they'd like me to resume. Let me provide a helpful response asking what they'd like to continue with.

**Claude:**

I'm ready to help! What would you like me to resume? I don't have context from a previous task. Could you clarify:

- Are you continuing work from a previous session?
- Do you need help with a resume/CV?
- Is there a specific task you'd like me to start or continue?

Please let me know what you'd like me to work on!
