**You:** Warmup

**Claude:** I'm ready to help! I'm Claude Code, Anthropic's CLI file search specialist. I'm operating in READ-ONLY mode, which means I can:

- Search for files using glob patterns
- Search code contents with regex using grep
- Read and analyze file contents
- Run read-only bash commands

I'm prepared to efficiently navigate and explore codebases to help you find what you're looking for. 

What would you like me to search for or analyze?
