**You:** you root?

<details><summary>💭 thinking</summary>
The user is asking if I'm root (have root privileges). This is a simple question about my current user permissions in the system. I should check what user I'm running as.

I can use the `whoami` command or check the `id` command to see what user I'm running as and whether I have root privileges.

This is a simple, straightforward question that doesn't require planning or a todo list.
</details>

**Claude:** I'll check what user I'm running as:

```bash
$ whoami
```

<details><summary>💭 thinking</summary>
The result shows I'm running as user "mischa", not root. I should provide a clear answer to the user.
</details>

**Claude:** No, I'm running as user `mischa`, not root. If you need to run commands with root privileges, you can use `sudo`.

**You:** where's your history(debug) saved?

<details><summary>💭 thinking</summary>
The user is asking where the debug/history for Claude Code is saved. This is a question about how Claude Code works - where it stores its conversation history, logs, or debug information.

This falls under the category of asking about Claude Code features ("how does Claude Code work", "where does Claude Code store..."). According to my instructions, when the user asks about how Claude Code works or specific features, I should use the Task tool with subagent_type='claude-code-guide' to get accurate information from the official documentation.
</details>

**Claude:** I'll look up where Claude Code saves its history and debug information:

*→ Task: Look up history/debug storage (claude-code-guide)*

<details><summary>💭 thinking</summary>
The agent provided good information about where Claude Code stores its configuration and settings. The key locations are:

- `~/.claude/` - User settings directory
- `~/.claude.json` - Global state file
- `.claude/` - Project settings directory
- Session data is stored locally for up to 30 days but the exact location isn't documented

The user asked specifically about history (debug), so they're probably looking for where conversation history or debug logs are saved. The agent mentioned that session data is stored locally for 30 days but the exact location isn't specified in the docs.

I should summarize this clearly for the user.
</details>

**Claude:** Based on the Claude Code documentation, here are the main storage locations:

**Configuration & Settings:**
- `~/.claude/` - User settings directory (settings.json, agents/, CLAUDE.md)
- `~/.claude.json` - Global state file (themes, OAuth, MCP configs, caches)
- `.claude/` - Project-level settings (in your project directory)

**Session History:**
Claude Code stores session data locally for up to 30 days to enable resuming conversations. However, the exact directory where conversation history/debug logs are stored isn't documented publicly.

**Debug Logs:**
The specific local debug log location isn't documented, but you can:
- Run `/doctor` to check installation health
- Run `/bug` to capture your full session for troubleshooting
- Use `DISABLE_TELEMETRY=1` or `DISABLE_ERROR_REPORTING=1` environment variables to disable external logging

If you need to find the actual conversation history files on disk, they're likely in `~/.claude/` or a subdirectory, but the exact location may require checking the source code or configuration.

**You:** what about debug?

<details><summary>💭 thinking</summary>
The user is asking specifically about debug logs/files. Let me check the ~/.claude/ directory and ~/.claude.json to see what's actually stored there, and look for any debug-related files.
</details>

**Claude:** Let me check what's actually in the Claude Code directories to find debug-related files:

```bash
$ ls -la ~/.claude/
```

```bash
$ find ~/.claude -type f -name "*debug*" -o -name "*log*" 2>/dev/null | head -20
```

<details><summary>💭 thinking</summary>
Great! I found it. There's a `debug` directory at `~/.claude/debug`. Let me check what's in there.
</details>

**Claude:** Found it! There's a `debug` directory at `~/.claude/debug`. Let me check what's inside:

```bash
$ ls -lah ~/.claude/debug/ | head -30
```

<details><summary>💭 thinking</summary>
Perfect! So the debug files are stored in `~/.claude/debug/` as text files with UUID names. These appear to be debug transcripts or session logs. Let me also show the user the history.jsonl file which likely contains conversation history.
</details>

**Claude:** **Debug logs are saved in:** `~/.claude/debug/`

Each session/conversation gets its own debug file named with a UUID (e.g., `0dc5503c-411e-4aad-a088-98dcf0539041.txt`). These are text files containing the full debug transcripts.

Additionally:
- **`~/.claude/history.jsonl`** - Contains conversation history in JSONL format
- **`~/.claude/file-history/`** - File modification history
- **`~/.claude/todos/`** - Todo list history
- **`~/.claude/session-env/`** - Session environment data

The current session's debug file appears to be one of the most recently modified files in the debug directory.

**You:** when was the first debug file created in this folder

<details><summary>💭 thinking</summary>
The user is asking when the first debug file was created in the ~/.claude/debug/ folder. I need to find the oldest file in that directory by creation/modification time.

Let me use ls with sorting by time to see the oldest files.
</details>

```bash
$ ls -lt ~/.claude/debug/ | tail -10
```

<details><summary>💭 thinking</summary>
The oldest file shown is from Dec 23 23:01. Let me get more precise timestamp information for that file.
</details>

```bash
$ stat ~/.claude/debug/e9df53f0-2f28-4eae-b198-7b3f9d0561c5.txt
```

<details><summary>💭 thinking</summary>
So the oldest debug file was created on December 23, 2025 at 23:01:40 (11:01 PM). The Birth time shows when the file was created. This appears to be when Claude Code started using this debug directory, or at least when the oldest remaining debug file was created.
</details>

**Claude:** The first (oldest) debug file in `~/.claude/debug/` was created on **December 23, 2025 at 23:01:40** (11:01 PM).

File: `e9df53f0-2f28-4eae-b198-7b3f9d0561c5.txt`

This suggests you've been using Claude Code since December 23rd, or at least that's when the oldest debug session that hasn't been cleaned up was created.
