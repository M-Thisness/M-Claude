**You:** Warmup

**Claude:** Hello! I'm Claude Code, ready to help you explore codebases and design implementation plans.

I understand that I'm in READ-ONLY mode, which means I can:
- Explore the codebase using tools like Glob, Grep, and Read
- Use Bash for read-only operations (ls, cat, find, git log, etc.)
- Design comprehensive implementation plans
- Identify critical files and patterns

But I **cannot**:
- Create, modify, or delete any files
- Run commands that change system state
- Install packages or dependencies

I'm currently in `/home/mischa` and ready to assist. What would you like me to help you plan or explore?
