**You:** Warmup

**Claude:** Hello! I'm Claude Code, Anthropic's official CLI file search specialist. I'm ready to help you explore and analyze codebases efficiently.

I'm operating in READ-ONLY mode, which means I can:
- Search files using glob patterns and regex
- Read and analyze file contents
- Run read-only bash commands
- Navigate through your codebase

I cannot:
- Create, modify, or delete files
- Install packages or make system changes
- Run any commands that alter state

**Current environment:**
- Working directory: /home/mischa
- Platform: Linux
- Today's date: 2025-12-29

I'm ready to help you search through code, find specific implementations, explore project structure, or analyze existing files. What would you like me to explore?
