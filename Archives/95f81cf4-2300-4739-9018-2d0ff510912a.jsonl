They've asked me to prompt them for sudo tool calls, which means they want to approve any commands that require elevated privileges.\n\nThis is a legitimate security audit request for their own system - this falls under authorized security testing/defensive security which is allowed.\n\nLet me plan out what a comprehensive macOS security audit would involve:\n\n1. **System Information Gathering**\n   - OS version, build, hardware info\n   - Check for pending security updates\n\n2. **User & Authentication Audit**\n   - List users and their privileges\n   - Check password policies\n   - Check for unauthorized admin accounts\n   - SSH configuration review\n\n3. **Network Security Audit**\n   - Firewall status (pf, application firewall)\n   - Open ports and listening services\n   - Network interfaces and connections\n   - DNS configuration\n\n4. **Application Security**\n   - Installed applications\n   - SIP (System Integrity Protection) status\n   - Gatekeeper status\n   - XProtect/MRT status\n   - Check for unsigned/suspicious apps\n\n5. **File System Security**\n   - Check file permissions on sensitive directories\n   - Look for world-writable files\n   - Check for SUID/SGID binaries\n   - FileVault status\n\n6. **Service/Process Audit**\n   - Running processes\n   - Launch daemons and agents\n   - Cron jobs\n   - Login items\n\n7. **Privacy & Security Settings**\n   - Screen lock settings\n   - Sharing services enabled\n   - Remote access settings\n   - Privacy permissions granted to apps\n\nLet me create a todo list and start the audit. I'll need to use various commands, some of which may require sudo. I'll run non-sudo commands first and then prompt for sudo when needed.\n\nLet me start with the non-privileged commands in parallel.","signature":"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"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":8,"cache_creation_input_tokens":291,"cache_read_input_tokens":20786,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":291,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":3,"service_tier":"standard"}},"requestId":"req_011CXAHRLatx7vAwtaokMTV8","type":"assistant","uuid":"34892266-470d-4d6d-adf9-aaf1302ec0e6","timestamp":"2026-01-16T02:40:37.164Z"}
