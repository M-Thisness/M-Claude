What is Helium Browser and its Relationship to Chromium?\n\nHelium is a privacy-focused, open-source web browser built on **ungoogled-chromium**, which is a Chromium variant with Google's tracking mechanisms and bloat removed. Helium extends ungoogled-chromium's philosophy with additional privacy features, design refinements, and user experience improvements.\n\n**Technical Foundation:**\n- Currently tracks Chromium version 141.0.7390.65\n- Uses the Blink rendering engine + V8 JavaScript engine from Chromium\n- Maintains compatibility with Chromium's web standards and DevTools\n- Licensed under GPL-3.0 for Helium-specific code\n\n**Key Privacy Modifications:**\n- Domain substitution: replaces Google domain references with a non-existent domain (qjz9zk)\n- Blocks all requests to domains containing qjz9zk and URLs with the trk: scheme\n- Removes Google's telemetry and data collection mechanisms\n- No built-in password manager or cloud sync (intentional for privacy)\n\n## 2. Browser Extension Support\n\n**Yes, Helium fully supports browser extensions** using the **Chrome Extension API** (Chromium WebExtensions).\n\nKey features:\n- **All Chromium extensions are supported** and work right away by default\n- **Full Manifest V2 support** - Helium commits to keeping MV2 support \"as long as possible\" even as Chrome phases it out\n- **Manifest V3 support** - Also supports the newer standard\n- **Privacy-protected downloads** - All Chrome Web Store requests are anonymized through Helium services so Google can't track extension downloads\n- **uBlock Origin** is integrated as a built-in component extension (compiled into ublock_resources.pak and loaded via ComponentLoader)\n\n**Android version** also supports full desktop-style extensions, which is unique among mobile browsers.\n\n## 3. Native Messaging and External Application APIs\n\nSince Helium is based on Chromium and **doesn't break any web APIs or standards**, it should support the **Native Messaging API** that's available in standard Chromium browsers. This API allows extensions to communicate with native applications running outside the browser sandbox.\n\nThe Native Messaging API requires:\n- The \"nativeMessaging\" permission in the extension's manifest.json\n- Messages serialized as UTF8-encoded JSON with 32-bit unsigned length prefix\n- Message size limits: up to 4GB to the host, 1MB from the host\n\nThere's no indication in the documentation of any Helium-specific customizations or limitations to this API.\n\n## 4. Architecture and Differences from Standard Chrome\n\n**Build Architecture:**\n- Separate repositories for different platforms (helium-windows, helium-linux)\n- Docker-based build system for Linux (`scripts/docker-build.sh`)\n- Python build scripts for Windows (`python3 build.py`, `python3 package.py`)\n\n**Key Architectural Differences:**\n\n| Feature | Chrome | Helium |\n|---------|--------|--------|\n| Base | Chromium + Google services | ungoogled-chromium |\n| Telemetry | Google tracking enabled | Completely removed |\n| Extension Store Access | Direct to Google | Anonymized via Helium services |\n| MV2 Extensions | Being phased out | Supported indefinitely |\n| Default Ad Blocking | None | uBlock Origin built-in |\n| Password Manager | Google account sync | None (privacy choice) |\n| Translation | Google Translate built-in | Requires extension |\n| Bloat | Google services included | Removed |\n\n**Additional Features:**\n- **Split view** - Open multiple web pages side-by-side in a single window\n- **Native !bangs** - Quick searching across different websites from the address bar\n- **Open source services** - Even the online services are open source and self-hostable\n\n## 5. Known Limitations and Differences in Extension Support\n\n**Limitations:**\n\n1. **Missing Built-in Features:**\n   - No built-in translation function (Google Translate removed)\n   - No password manager or cloud sync\n   - Some Chrome-specific features may be absent\n\n2. **Extension Compatibility:**\n   - Extensions tightly bound to Google APIs may require manual installation or fail\n   - Extension conflicts can occur with multiple extensions (common to all browsers)\n\n3. **Android-Specific Challenges:**\n   - Service worker lifecycle management complexity with MV3\n   - Background page limitations on mobile devices\n   - Resource constraints affecting traditional extension architectures\n   - Maintaining Chromium patch compatibility over time\n\n4. **Update Dependencies:**\n   - Some extensions may have issues if Chrome or external services (like Amazon) update suddenly\n   - Maintaining compatibility with rapidly evolving Chromium codebase\n\n**Advantages Over Chrome:**\n\n- Indefinite Manifest V2 support (critical for privacy extensions like uBlock Origin)\n- Privacy-protected extension downloads\n- No Google tracking or data collection\n- Lighter resource footprint\n- Full extension support on Android\n\nOverall, Helium appears to be a robust privacy-focused alternative to Chrome with near-complete extension compatibility, while prioritizing user privacy and removing Google's ecosystem dependencies.\n\n---\n\n## Sources:\n\n- [GitHub - imputnet/helium: Private, fast, and honest web browser](https://github.com/imputnet/helium)\n- [Helium Browser](https://helium.computer/)\n- [Helium Browser for Android: Chromium Reborn with Extensions and Privacy at Core - LavX News](https://news.lavx.hu/article/helium-browser-for-android-chromium-reborn-with-extensions-and-privacy-at-core)\n- [Is Helium the Browser Brave Was Meant to Be?](https://itsfoss.com/helium-browser/)\n- [🥷 Helium Browser Review: Anonymous Browsing In 2025](https://whoerip.com/blog/helium-browser/)\n- [Helium Browser: privacy-centred Chromium, without the extras | Edward Kiledjian](https://kiledjian.com/2025/10/16/helium-browser-privacycentred-chromium-without.html)\n- [imputnet/helium-chromium | DeepWiki](https://deepwiki.com/imputnet/helium-chromium/1-overview)\n- [Helium Services | imputnet/helium-chromium | DeepWiki](https://deepwiki.com/imputnet/helium-chromium/5-helium-customizations)\n- [GitHub - jqssun/android-helium-browser: Private and secure Android browser with support for browser extensions](https://github.com/jqssun/android-helium-browser)\n- [Helium Browser Brings Desktop-Style Extensions to Android, Sparking Developer Debate - BigGo News](https://biggo.com/news/202510270722_Helium_Browser_Android_Extensions_Support)\n- [The best Chromium browser isn't Chrome, it's Helium](https://coywolf.com/news/productivity/the-best-chrome-browser-for-mac-windows-linux-isnt-chrome-its-helium/)\n- [I tried out the Chromium-based browser 'Helium,' which comes with an ad blocker as standard - GIGAZINE](https://gigazine.net/gsc_news/en/20250927-helium-ad-blocking/)\n- [GitHub - imputnet/helium-windows: Helium Browser for Windows](https://github.com/imputnet/helium-windows)\n- [GitHub - imputnet/helium-linux: Helium Browser for Linux](https://github.com/imputnet/helium-linux)"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1717,"cache_creation_input_tokens":3633,"cache_read_input_tokens":11368,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":3633,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":1,"service_tier":"standard"}},"requestId":"req_011CWeBhya1mgC9RrfzVRD3J","type":"assistant","uuid":"9f9f13b6-3772-4cc3-8599-496edaffb252","timestamp":"2025-12-31T05:08:23.873Z"}
