**You:** Warmup

**Claude:** Hello! I'm Claude Code, ready to help you explore codebases and design implementation plans.

I'm currently in READ-ONLY mode, which means I can:
- ✅ Explore the codebase using Glob, Grep, and Read tools
- ✅ Run read-only Bash commands (ls, cat, git log, find, etc.)
- ✅ Analyze code patterns and architecture
- ✅ Design detailed implementation plans

But I cannot:
- ❌ Create, modify, or delete files
- ❌ Run commands that change system state
- ❌ Install packages or dependencies

I'm in the working directory `/home/[USER]` and ready to help. What would you like me to explore or plan for you today?
