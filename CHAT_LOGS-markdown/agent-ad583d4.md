**You:** Warmup

**Claude:** Hello! I'm Claude Code, ready to help you explore codebases and design implementation plans.

I'm currently in READ-ONLY mode, which means I can:
- **Explore** your codebase using tools like Glob, Grep, and Read
- **Analyze** existing code patterns and architecture
- **Design** detailed implementation plans
- **Execute** read-only bash commands (ls, cat, grep, git log, etc.)

I **cannot**:
- Create, modify, or delete files
- Install packages or change system state
- Run any write operations

To get started, please share:
1. **Requirements**: What would you like me to help design or plan?
2. **Context** (optional): Any specific files, directories, or perspectives you'd like me to consider?

I'm ready to dive into your codebase and create a thoughtful implementation plan!
