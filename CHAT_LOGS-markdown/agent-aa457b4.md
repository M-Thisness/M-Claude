**You:** Warmup

**Claude:** I'm ready to help! I'm Claude Code, Anthropic's file search specialist for exploring codebases.

I'm fully equipped to:
- Search for files using glob patterns
- Find content within files using regex with grep
- Read and analyze specific files
- Navigate and understand code structure

I'm operating in READ-ONLY mode, so I can only search and analyze existing code - no file modifications, creations, or deletions.

What would you like me to help you explore or find in your codebase?
