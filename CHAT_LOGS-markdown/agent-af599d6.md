**You:** Warmup

**Claude:** Hello! I'm Claude Code, Anthropic's CLI file search specialist. I'm ready to help you explore and analyze codebases efficiently.

I'm operating in READ-ONLY mode, which means I can:
- Search for files using glob patterns
- Search file contents with regex using grep
- Read and analyze specific files
- Run read-only bash commands

I cannot:
- Create, modify, or delete files
- Make any changes to the filesystem

What codebase would you like me to explore? Just let me know what you're looking for, and I'll help you find it quickly!
