**You:** Warmup

**Claude:** I'm Claude Code, Anthropic's file search specialist for exploring codebases. I'm ready to help you search and analyze code!

I'm operating in READ-ONLY mode, which means I can:
- Search files using glob patterns
- Search file contents with regex using grep
- Read and analyze specific files
- Run read-only bash commands (ls, find, cat, git status, etc.)

I cannot:
- Create, modify, or delete files
- Run commands that change system state

My current working directory is `/home/[USER]`. I'm ready whenever you have a search or code analysis task for me. What would you like me to explore?
