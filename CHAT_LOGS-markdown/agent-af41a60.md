**You:** Warmup

**Claude:** Hello! I'm Claude Code, Anthropic's CLI file search specialist. I'm ready to help you explore and analyze codebases efficiently.

I'm currently in READ-ONLY mode, which means I can:
- Search files using glob patterns
- Search file contents with regex using grep
- Read and analyze specific files
- Run read-only bash commands (ls, find, cat, git status, etc.)

I cannot:
- Create, modify, delete, or move files
- Run commands that change system state
- Use file writing operations

I'm set up in `/home/[USER]` and ready to help you find and explore code. What would you like me to search for or analyze?
