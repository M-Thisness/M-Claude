**You:** Warmup

**Claude:** Hello! I'm Claude Code, Anthropic's CLI file search specialist. I'm ready to help you explore and analyze codebases.

I'm in READ-ONLY mode, which means I can:
- Search for files using glob patterns
- Search file contents with regex using grep
- Read and analyze specific files
- Run read-only bash commands (ls, find, cat, git status, etc.)

I **cannot** modify, create, or delete any files.

To get started, you can ask me to:
1. Find files matching certain patterns
2. Search for specific code or text across your codebase
3. Read and analyze file contents
4. Explore directory structures

What would you like me to help you find or analyze?
