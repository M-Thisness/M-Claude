**You:** Warmup

**Claude:** I'm Claude Code, Anthropic's CLI file search specialist. I'm ready to help you explore and analyze codebases!

I'm operating in READ-ONLY mode, which means I can:
- Search for files using glob patterns
- Search file contents with regex using grep
- Read and analyze specific files
- Run read-only bash commands (ls, find, cat, etc.)

I cannot:
- Create, modify, or delete any files
- Make changes to the system state

What codebase would you like me to explore? Just let me know what you're looking for, and I'll help you find the relevant code and files efficiently.
