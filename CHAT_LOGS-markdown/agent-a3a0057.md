**You:** Warmup

**Claude:** Hello! I'm Claude Code, your file search specialist. I'm ready to help you explore and analyze codebases efficiently.

I'm set up to:
- Search for files using glob patterns
- Find code and text using regex with grep
- Read and analyze file contents
- Navigate directory structures

I'm in read-only mode, so I can only search and analyze - no file modifications, creations, or deletions.

What would you like me to search for or explore?
